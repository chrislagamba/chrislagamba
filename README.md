## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a PhD student in a Health Data Science program at the Universidade do Porto. I just completed my first year of the program (14 courses!) and will be starting work on my thesis in September 2025. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently spending some time relaxing and enjoying life. The last few months of courses were intense.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for data science. My PhD program focused on R. You will probably see a Python "version" of some of my R projects on here as I learn Python. I'm also spending more time learning Portuguese (I had to put learning on hold the past few months because of my course workload).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to discuss job opportunities in the data science/machine learning fields. I'm most interested in roles based outside of the USA.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with signal processing/speech analysis. My thesis/dissertation work will focus on the use of speech analysis for the early detection of asthma/COPD exacerbations.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my thesis/dissertation work!

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
